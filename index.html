"Since 1990, the world has cut the rate of child deaths by more than one half.
In 2015, an estimated 5.9 million children under the age of five will still die, equivalent to 11 every minute."-UNICEF

          <div class="title" style="border-bottom:1px solid #e5e4e1">This is the world map based on child mortality rate</div>
        When we hover the map to see the trend line, we can see that the under five child mortality rate is decreasing for almost every country.

        <div class="title" style="border-bottom:1px solid #e5e4e1">Here is Haiti</div>
          You can see the trend line for Haiti has a steep slope in 2010.<br>
          The 2010 Haiti earthquake was a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 Mw earthquake. An estimated three million people were affected by the quake.<br>
          But the trend line went back to its normal decreasing trend in 2011.

          You can see the trend line for Rwanda has a steep slope in 1994.<br>
          The 1994 Rwandan Genocide was a genocidal mass slaughter of Tutsi and moderate Hutu in Rwanda by members of the Hutu majority. An estimated 500,000-1,000,000 Rwandans were killed, constituting as much as 70% of the Tutsi and 20% of Rwanda's total population.<br>
          But the trend line did not go back to its normal decreasing trend until 2000!!!
